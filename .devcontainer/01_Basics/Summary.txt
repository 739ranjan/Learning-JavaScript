** Types of data types from memory perspective
1. Primitive Type : It is also called value types
    It has 7 different types
        i. String => let name = "Shashi"
        ii. Number => let num = 123
        iii. Boolean => let isTrue = true
        iv. null => let temperature = null
        v. undefined => let sky; or let sky = undefined
        vi. Symbol => 
            let id = Symbol('123')
            let newId = Symbol('123')
            console.log(id === newId) // false since both are unique symbol
        vii. BigInt => let bigNumber = 2536475187863498564876956758736986483465n
2. Non primitive or Reference type
    It has 3 different types
        i. Array => let arr = ["saktimaan", "flyingJaat", "MrIndia", "naagraj"]
        ii. Objects =>
            let myObj = {
                name : "Shashi",
                age : 22
            }
        iii. Functions => 
            const myFunction = function(){
                console.log("My Function");
            }


** JavaScript is Dynamically typed langauge as we need not explicitly tell which data type variable is defied
ex: let num = 33
    num = "Shashi"

** To know the data typ eof any variablewe use typeof function 
ex: let name = "Shashi"
    console.log(typeof(name))

** data type of null is object
